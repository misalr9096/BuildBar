          <h1 class="names">JOHN HEERON</h1>
          <p>
            Whether you’re new to boxing or a seasoned fighter, John can teach
            you a thing or two about keeping fit for the ring and understanding
            your opponent.<br /><br />

            While he comes from the world of professional boxing, John takes a
            holistic approach to fitness, and is just as likely to throw you
            into a yoga class as he is to throw you around the boxing ring.
